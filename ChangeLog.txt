Version 0.8.3 - 1/14/11
	All:
		Add ASIHTTPRequest plus proxying support (read: I got a 3 day ban on /g/). For now proxy settings go directly through NSUserDefaults. This is bad, but CKUtil wasn't really designed with a more elegant way to do this. It's a temporary solution.
		Similarly preliminary handling of bans. Currently confined to a document fetch error code.
		Clang got smarter -- fix some leaks.
		Use block enumerations in some cases where foreach was previously.
		Prettyprint descriptions for bash, just for the hell of it. No greentext yet.
	CKRecipe:
		Lookups now use NSObject's valueForKeyPath method, path delimiter changed to '.' accordingly.
		Now automatically tries to detect software if a lookup method is called without previously running detection.
		New certainty state -- CK_RECIPE_PRELIMINARY -- set during detection to avoid a stack overflow created by the former.
		This singleton will likely be partially or wholly replaced by the planned CKDocument class, each instance of which will store its own definitions.
	CKPoster:
		Field HTTP keys moved to recipe.
		Fix sefault when no error is sent to -post.
		Now returns a post on duplicate image error, as the board does. It's a good idea to always check the error code.
	CKPage:
		-newestPost -> -mostRecentPost as per naming convention.
	ChanParse:
		-proxy flag.
		Captcha images aren't tiff anymore, don't name them that.
		Add some more post error states.
		Use URLs instead of strings for path flags and UTIs to check upload images.
		Flag to verify a list of proxies against a URL and print working/not-banned ones.
		Image dumping can use a proxy list.
		Image dumping can be resumed based on filenames present in the thread.
		Image dumping can attach the dump progress to the post comment.
	Other:
		Miscellaneous changes (see previous git logs).
		Re-establish the other arbitrary version numbering.

Version 0.9.0pre - 12/20/10 - Pre-0.9 Git import
	All:
		Prefix header -> Common.h.
		Fix some massive retain errors and implement dealloc in all classes. This will probably result in various memleaks, let clang sort that out in the future.
		Partial XML writing support using custom, ChanKit-native formatting.
		Xcode's Clang 1.6 fixes RegexKitLite build issues, make it the default.
		Upgrade RegexKitLite to latest SVN (r68).
	CKImage:
		CKImage class to ease iOS/OS X cross-compatibility, sanitize the metadata situation, abstract data retrieval and storage, and provide imageboard-relevant convenience methods.	
	CKPoster:
		Preliminary posting support including reCAPTCHA, post attempt templates, and return data parsing.
	CKRecipe:
		URL matching for supported sites of various resource types (images, threads, etc).
		Recipe changes to accommodate arbitrary numbers of alternate paths. The "Path" key may now be an ordered array of XPaths to test (it can still be a string if there are no alternates). This deprecates the "Alternate" key and helps us get around any shortcomings of the XPath library. Recipe documentation has been amended to reflect this change.
	CKBoard:
		New stat methods: newestPost, optimized newestPostID, and unholy abomination findPostForImage.
	CKPage:
		Likewise: newestPost, oldestPost, and time-interval rangeOfPosts.
	CKPost:
		New storage container for in-comment context with quotes, admin messages, etc. Incidentally, these are now broken.
	ChanParse:
		Rudimentary reCAPTCHA posting support.
		Sanitize image dumping thanks to CKImage.
	Other:
		Miscellaneous changes and cleanup.

Version 0.8.1 - 10/17/10
	All:
		CSA bug fixing
		Send NULL to NSError parameters rather than nil; no practical difference, but seems to be convention.
	CKUser:
		Authority now tested individually via regular expressions as not all software groups privilege level in the same element.
	CKThread:
		More accurately named vars (imagereplies included the OP, now imagecount)
		Convenience methods to get all posts containing images or all images themselves
	ChanParse:
		Image dumping with the -url -dump command

Version 0.8.0 - 10/16/10
	Initial release.
